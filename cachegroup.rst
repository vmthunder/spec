===============================================================================
Add cachegroup support
===============================================================================

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/cinder/+spec/

Traditional hard disk drive(HDD) has become a performance bottleneck compared
with CPU, memory and network. High-end storage(solid state drive, even memory)
is much faster than HDD, but has lower capacity, shorter lifetime and higher
price issues. Some block-level caching solutions(flashcache, bcache, dm-cache,
lvm-cache) enhance storage performance by using a fast device as cache of the
slow devices. We propose to improve these solutions by enabling a group of fast
caching devices to collaboratively service a group of slow storage devices.


Problem description
===================

Currently, there is no general cache support for block device in cinder. Data is
stored in volumes of cinder servers and attached to compute nodes. To take full
advantage of local storage devices(HDDs and SSDs) of the compute nodes, we
need to cache data on them. Thus, compute nodes will access data in local
cache before send I/O requests to servers. To achieve this goal, there are some
challenges.

1.  Since compute nodes dynamically attach and release volumes from servers,
    the cache scheme must support dynamically changing configurations, which
    supports to add and remove disks freely.
2.  The cache scheme for cinder should support different kinds of cache modules
    (e.g. flashcache, and bcache).


Proposed change
===============
We propose the following changes,

* Cinder should set up a database record indicates which volume is cached.The
  main code to implement cache scheme can be put to the path /cinder/volume or
  /cinder/volume/ driver in Cinder, and CinderClient can use it through RPC.
* On the CinderClient side, we should set up a configuration option to
  indicate whether to use the cache or not. If this option is True, the cache
  environment will be initiated when CinderClient starts.
* When Nova uses/attaches to a volume in Cinder,Nova should pass a parameter to
  indicate whether this volume will be cached in compute node or not.
  CinderClient add a volume to the cache according to Nova's parameter.


The details of dynamically making cache for a group of(one or multiple) HDDs
by a group of SSDs is as follows. Since we have already implemented the grouping
functionality for flashcache, we take FlashCacheGroup (fcg) as an example to
illustrate the procedure.

1.  Fcg uses dm-linear to create a logical group of HDDs and combine all SSDs.
2.  Fcg makes cache of logical HDD group with the linear combined SSDs,
    called cached group.
3.  When adding HDD to the logical HDD group, fcg splits a cached HDD out of
    the cached group by using dm-linear accordingly.
4.  When removing HDD from the logical HDD group, fcg also removes the cached
    HDD accordingly.

(refer to https://github.com/lihuiba/flashcachegroup for detail)

Besides fcg, we are also implementing the cache group functionality for
bcache following the same procedure.


Alternatives
------------

DM-Cache
DM-Cache uses I/O scheduling and cache management techniques optimized for
flash-based SSDs. The device mapper target (DM-Cache) reuses the metadata
library used in the thin-provisioning library. Both write-back and
write-through are supported by DM-Cache. The problem of DM-Cache is that its
metadata device is not easy to handle, and SSD still cannot be removed freely
so far.

LVM-Cache
LVM-Cache is built on top of DM-Cache so that logical volumes can be turned into
cache devices. Because of that, LVM-Cache splits the cache pool LV into two
devices - the cache data LV and cache metadata LV. LVM-Cache will face the same
problem with DM-Cache.
